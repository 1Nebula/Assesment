## Question 1

You are tasked with designing a big data environment in Azure for a retail company that wants to analyze large volumes of data to gain insights into customer behavior, inventory management, and sales trends. Please outline your approach to designing this Azure-based big data environment. Consider the following requirements:

1. Data Sources:

    * Data sources include transactional databases, IoT sensors, log files, and external data feeds.
    * Data should be ingested in real-time and batch processing modes.

2. Data Storage:

    * You need to store both structured and unstructured data efficiently.
    * Historical data should be archived for compliance and analysis.

3. Data Processing:

    * Perform real-time and batch data processing and transformation.
    * Leverage big data technologies for analysis, including machine learning and data mining.

4. Scalability and Performance:

    * The solution must be scalable to handle increasing data volumes.
    * Ensure high performance for data processing and analytics.

5. Security and Compliance:

    * Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data.
    * Ensure compliance with industry regulations and data governance policies.

6. Data Visualization:

    * Enable users to visualize insights through dashboards and reports.

Describe the architecture of your Azure-based big data environment. Include the Azure services and tools you would use, the data flow, and the components involved. Explain how you would address data ingestion, storage, processing, scalability, security, and data visualization.

## Question 2

Imagine you are designing a data model for an e-commerce platform. The system needs to capture information about customers, products, orders, and order items. Please describe how you would approach modeling these entities and their relationships. Consider the following requirements:

1. Customers can place multiple orders, and each order is associated with a single customer.
2. Each order can contain multiple items, and each item is associated with a single order.
3. Products can be associated with multiple orders, but each product can only appear once in a single order.
4. You need to capture customer information, including name, address, and contact details.
5. Products have attributes like name, price, and description.
6. Orders should store details such as order date, total price, and order status.

Describe the entities, attributes, relationships, and any constraints you would use in your data model. Explain your choices and consider which data modeling approach (e.g., Entity-Relationship Diagram, relational schema) would be the most suitable for this scenario.

## Question 3

You are tasked with designing a data warehouse for a retail company. The data warehouse needs to handle historical data and accommodate slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) for products and employees. Please outline your approach to designing the data warehouse schema, specifically addressing the handling of SCDs for products and employees. Consider the following requirements:

1. Products:

    * Products have attributes such as name, category, price, and description.
    * You need to maintain a history of changes to the product attributes over time.
    * New product versions may be introduced, and you must track these changes.

2. Employees:

    * Employee data includes attributes like name, contact details, job title, and department.
    * Employee promotions, transfers, and salary changes should be tracked and accessible in historical reports.

3. Sales:

    * The data warehouse should store sales data, including information about products, customers, sales dates, and quantities sold.
    * The sales data must reference the historical product and employee information.

Describe the schema for your data warehouse, including the structure of the product and employee dimensions. Explain how you would implement SCDs for these dimensions and provide an example of how you would represent historical changes for a product and an employee.

## Question 4

You are responsible for designing the data distribution strategy for a data warehousing project in Azure dedicated SQL pool. The project includes various tables with different characteristics and usage patterns. Explain how you would determine the appropriate distribution method for each of the following tables and provide reasons for your choices:

1. Sales Fact Table:

    * This table contains daily sales data for the last five years.
    * It's used for complex ad-hoc analytics, including aggregation and filtering.
    * The table is large and experiences frequent queries.

2. Customer Dimension Table:

    * This table stores customer information, including name, address, and contact details.
    * It's updated infrequently and primarily used for lookups in reports.

3. Product Dimension Table:

    * This table includes information about products, such as name, category, and price.
    * It's used for both lookups and joins with the sales fact table.

4. Inventory Snapshot Table:

    * This table records daily inventory levels for various products.
    * It's used for inventory tracking and historical reports.

For each table, specify the distribution method you would choose (e.g., round-robin, hash, or replicated), and explain the reasons behind your decision. Discuss how your distribution choices would impact query performance and data loading.

## Question 5

You are responsible for managing data in an Azure environment for a large organization. The organization deals with massive volumes of data, and you need to ensure efficient data lifecycle management. Please outline your approach to effectively managing the lifecycle of data in Azure. Consider the following requirements:

1. Data Types:

    * The organization's data includes structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data, and it's generated by various sources.

2. Data Retention:

    * Different types of data need to be retained for varying periods. For example, transactional data must be retained for regulatory compliance, while log data can be retained for a shorter time.

3. Archiving:

    * Historical data needs to be archived for long-term storage cost-effectively.

4. Data Deletion:

    * Outdated or irrelevant data should be identified and safely deleted to optimize storage and reduce costs.

5. Data Governance:

    * Data governance policies and compliance requirements must be adhered to throughout the data lifecycle.

Describe how you would implement data lifecycle management in Azure. Include details on Azure services, tools, and best practices you would use to address data retention, archiving, deletion, and governance. Explain how you would categorize and manage data based on its lifecycle stage, and discuss the advantages of using Azure for data lifecycle management.
